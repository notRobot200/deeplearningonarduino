# deeplearningonarduino

This project is the result of a major assignment in the Intelligent Systems course, focusing on hardware implementation with AI. In this project, I developed a real-time Rock, Paper, Scissors detection system using a CNN model. This real-time detection is then connected to hardware with the following responses:

Rock: Turns on a green light
Paper: Turns on a red light
Scissors: Triggers an alarm

The following hardware and software were used in this project.

Hardware:
- breadboard 830 point mb-102
- arduino UNO r3 ch340
- arduino UNO cable 30cm
- male to male jumper cables
- led green and red
- buzzer
- laptop that has a webcam
  
Software:
