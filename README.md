# deeplearningonarduino

This project is the result of a major assignment in the Intelligent Systems course, focusing on hardware implementation with AI. In this project, I developed a real-time Rock, Paper, Scissors detection system using a CNN model. This real-time detection is then connected to hardware with the following responses:

Rock: Turns on a green light
Paper: Turns on a red light
Scissors: Triggers an alarm

The following hardware and software were used in this project.

Hardware:
- Breadboard 830 point mb-102
- Arduino UNO r3 ch340
- Arduino UNO cable 30cm
- Male to male jumper cables
- Led green and red
- Buzzer
- Laptop that has a webcam
  
Software:
- Arduino IDE
- PyCharm
